<h2>C3W1_Assignment: Explore the BBC News archive</h2>
<p>In this assignment, a variation of the BBC News Classification Dataset will be processed, which contains 2225 examples of news articles with their respective categories (labels).</p>
<code>In this part, functions have been implemented to process various text data processing ranging from pre-processing, reading from raw files and tokenizing text.</code>

<h2>C3W2_Assignment: Diving deeper into the BBC News archive</h2>
<p>In this assignment, the BBC News Classification Dataset used, which contains 2225 examples of news articles with their respective labels.</p>
<code>The tokenization process would be done, a classifier using specialized layers for text data such as Embedding and GlobalAveragePooling1D will be created.</code>

<h2>C3W3_Assignment: Exploring overfitting in NLP</h2>
<p>A variation of the Sentiment140 dataset used, which contains 1.6 million tweets alongside their respective sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive).</p>
<code>Overfitting, often stemming from a small training dataset with limited vocabulary, was mitigated in this assignment. Two key solutions were employed: training on a larger dataset for diversity and incorporating transfer learning with existing embeddings to enhance the model's understanding and prevent overgeneralization.</code>

<h2>C3W4_Assignment: Predicting the next word</h2>
<p>In this assignment, a model that will predict the next word in a text sequence is created. A corpus of Shakespeare sonnetswill be utilized to train a model.</p>
<code>The model trained using a corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets, while also creating some helper functions to pre-process the data. Then, the model used to create poetry!</code>
